  <h1>Day 2 Challenge</h1>
  <h2>Day 2 Solution</h2>

    <p>Day 2 was enjoyable because it introduced input functions which allowed me to communicate with the user to gather input and apply responses to my my code. The challenge was to ask for the user's name, favorite food, favorite music and where they live.   
        The solution was to use the the input functions name, food, and live: 

        

    <ul>
        <li>name = input("What is you name?: ") </li>
        <li>food = input("What is your favorite food? ")</li> 
        <li>live = input("Where do you live? ")</li>
    </ul>
