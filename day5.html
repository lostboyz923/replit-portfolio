  <h1>Day 5 Challenge</h1>
  <h2>Day 5 Solution</h2>

  <p>In this challenge we learned about if statements. This was my first time learning a programming language, so learning how, "if and only if" statements worked was very interesting. I also learned about the modulo operator, which is a very useful tool 
    calculating the remainder when dividing two numbers.  Understanding how to use if statements is very important for programming, and I'm glad I learned how to use them. Now we can 
    utilize emergence and complexity.</p>
    
  <ul>
    <li>if spiderMan == "yes":
        print("Than you might be Spider-Man")
    else:
        print("Than you're not Spider-Man")</li>
    <li>if spiderMan == "yes" and superman == "yes":</li>
    <li>if batMan == "yes":
        print("Than you might be the next Batman.")
    else:
        print("Than you won't have the money to become the next Batman")</li>
    <li>if wolVerine == "yes":
        print("Than you might have the powers of the wolverine!")
    else:
        print("Than you weren't blessed with the powers of the wolverine.")</li>
