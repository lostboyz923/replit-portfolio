  <h1>Day 14 Challenge</h1>
  <h2>Day 14 Solution</h2>

  <p>Up to this point we've learned, input and output, if/elif/else statements, basic mathematics, casting as float and int, and using the debugger tool to squash bugs. For todays challenge we had to build a rock 
    paper and scissors game. I used the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 3. I then used if/elif/else statements to determine the winner. I also used a while loop to keep the game going until the user won or lost.
    Not to mention rock paper and scissors is a fun game to play.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>if Alice == "R":
      if Bob == "R":
          print("You both picked rock, so this is a tie.")
      elif Bob == "P":
          print("Bob wins!")
      elif Bob == "S":
          print("Alice wins!")
      else:
          print("Invalid response!")</li>
  <li>elif Alice == "P":
      if Bob == "R":
          print("Alice wins!")
      elif Bob == "P":
          print("Tie")
      elif Bob == "S":
          print("Bob wins!")
      else:
          print("Invalid response!")</li>
  <li>elif Alice == "S":
      if Bob == "R":
          print("Bob wins!")
      elif Bob == "P":
          print("Alice wins!")
      elif Bob == "S":
          print("Tie.")</li>
  <li>else:
      print("Invalid response!")</li>
  </ul>
