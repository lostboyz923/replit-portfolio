  <h1>Day 12 Challenge</h1>
  <h2>Day 12 Solution</h2>

  <p>In this challenge we learned how to squash bugs and pin point errors in our code by utilizing the debugger tool. Its pretty self explanatory as we just marked the 
    line in our code we wished to run the debugger from and then ran the debugger. We then were able to see the values of our variables and see where the error was in our code. 
    We could also see the values of our variables change as we stepped through the code. This was a very useful tool and I'm glad I learned how to use it.

  <ul>
    <li>def add(a, b):</li>
    <li>return a + b</li>
    <li>def subtract(a, b):</li>
    <li>return a - b</li>
    <li>def multiply(a, b):</li>
    <li>return a * b</li>
    <li>def divide(a, b):</li>
    <li>return a / b</li>
    <li>print("I'm going use the calculator functions to multiply 5 and 6")</li>
    <li>x = multiply(5, 6)</li>
    <li>print(x)</li>
    <li>print("I'm going use the calculator functions to divide 6 and 2")</li>
    <li>y = divide(6, 2)</li>
    <li>print(y)</li>
    <li>print("I'm going use the calculator functions to add 5 and 6")</li>
    <li>z = add(5, 6)</li>
    <li>print(z)</li>
    <li>print("I'm going use the calculator functions to subtract 6 and 2")</li>
    <li>a = subtract(6, 2)</li>
    <li>print(a)</li>
  <ul>
